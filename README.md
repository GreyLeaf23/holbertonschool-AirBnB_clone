## AirBnb Console - Project's Intention

Similar to how we created a simple shell using
the C Language, we are creating a command
interpreter that works in similar fashion but is
limited to specific use-cases.

Use-cases our project will be able to manage:

* Create new objects (ex: new User or a new
Place).
* Retrieve an object from a file, a database, etc.
* Do operations on objects (count, compute stats,
etc).
* Update attributes of an object.
* Destroy an object.

## Program's Usage:
